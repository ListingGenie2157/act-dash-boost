  },
  "product_overview": "An ACT preparation application tailored to U.S. high school students, featuring onboarding, diagnostic assessments, daily drills, timed simulation tests, progress tracking, and administrative content management. The app focuses on realistic practice, adaptive learning based on weak areas, and maintaining user engagement through streaks and reminders, delivered via a mobile-first, secure, and accessible platform.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable students to improve ACT scores through realistic and adaptive practice.",
    "Engage users with motivational features like streaks, XP, and timely reminders.",
    "Provide transparent progress tracking and personalized pacing insights for students and parents.",
    "Ensure data security and privacy with strict row-level security and user data isolation.",
    "Deliver a performant, reliable, and accessible learning experience across devices."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Multi-step onboarding wizard capturing consent, test date, accommodations, preferences, and goals with data persistence and routing.",
    "Diagnostic assessment to establish baseline skills, identify top weak areas, and generate a personalized 7-day study plan.",
    "Daily untimed drills focusing on weak topics with answer persistence, scoring, and explanations available.",
    "Timed ACT section simulator incorporating accommodations multipliers with autosave, consistent grading, and mid-section resume capability.",
    "Full ACT test simulation with back-to-back sections and per-section result reporting.",
    "Spaced repetition review mode for retention of past mistakes with scheduled rescheduling intervals.",
    "Dashboard displaying progress metrics including accuracy, streaks, upcoming reviews, and actionable next steps.",
    "Secure admin interface for TSV content import with idempotency, error handling, and restricted access.",
    "Offline support through queued answers syncing upon reconnection (post-MVP).",
    "Parent portal providing read-only access to student progress and reports."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Onboarding: Users proceed through age consent, test date setting, accommodations selection, goals and preferred study window, notification preferences, accessibility options, and mode choice, culminating in redirection to diagnostic or plan start.",
    "Diagnostic: Execute a ~30 minute test path, receive per-section and overall results, auto-generate study plans and schedule follow-up reviews.",
    "Drills: Select subjects and skills, practice untimed questions while answers persist through refreshes, end with summaries and queue wrong answers for review.",
    "Timed Section: Load content, shuffle choices per question, persist attempts with correct grading, time with accommodations multiplier, allow mid-test refresh and autosave, finalize with detailed scoring and summary.",
    "Review Mode: Present due review items in spaced intervals with previous attempts and explanations; allow user feedback to reschedule or mark as mastered.",
    "Admin Import: Admin users securely upload TSV formatted content via an Edge Function, validating and skipping duplicates while populating content tables.",
    "Dashboard: Display real-time progress insights, accuracy, streaks, XP counters, and next recommended actions to students and optionally parents."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Onboarding completes within 90 seconds for new users with data persistence and seamless resume after refresh.",
    "Diagnostic test completion triggers correct generation of a personalized 7-day plan and schedules review items.",
    "Drill answers persist through page refreshes with explanations accessible, and wrong answers are properly enqueued for review.",
    "Timed section answers persist mid-test; timers respect accommodations, and summaries accurately reflect scoring and timing on refresh.",
    "Full test simulator produces per-section pause-and-resume results consistent across sessions.",
    "Review mode honors scheduling logic with appropriate rescheduling and queuing of past incorrect attempts.",
    "Admin TSV import succeeds only for authorized admins, performs idempotently, and surfaces errors gracefully.",
    "Dashboard loads within 1 second on repeat visits using cached data, showing accurate progress metrics.",
    "RLS policies enforced rigorously to prevent cross-user data access, validated by automated negative tests.",
    "Accessibility standards met including keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and toggles for reduced motion and dyslexia font.",
    "Error handling is comprehensive with proper fallback UIs for loading, failure, and empty data states.",
    "Strict TypeScript compliance with zero errors and comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests."
