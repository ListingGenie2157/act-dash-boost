## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement: Authentication and User Management
- **Description:** Core authentication system including login, signup, and user account management functionality.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC001
- **Test Name:** Onboarding Completion with Data Persistence
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Onboarding_Completion_with_Data_Persistence.py](./TC001_Onboarding_Completion_with_Data_Persistence.py)
- **Test Error:** The onboarding flow cannot be tested because account creation and login attempts fail with 'Invalid login credentials' error. No alternative login or guest access is available. Please fix the authentication issue to enable onboarding flow testing.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d0079e08-e8cc-4bf5-803d-d3198920db0b/29dd33fa-0469-4cf2-a361-f7fdf12fbf94
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** The test failed because the onboarding flow requires successful account creation and login, which are currently blocked due to authentication failures with invalid login credentials. Without successful login, onboarding steps cannot be tested.

---

#### Test 2

## 4️⃣ Critical Issues Summary

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKER: Authentication System Failure**

**Issue:** All 14 test cases failed due to authentication system failures including:
- Email validation rejecting valid email addresses
- Account creation blocked by validation errors
- Login failures with "Invalid login credentials" errors
- Rate limiting preventing account creation attempts

**Impact:** 
- Complete inability to access any application features
- No validation of core functionality
- Application unusable for end users
- Zero functional test coverage achieved

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Email Validation Logic:** Valid email addresses are being rejected as invalid
2. **Authentication Endpoints:** Supabase auth endpoints returning 400/401 errors
3. **Rate Limiting:** Account creation attempts being rate limited
4. **Credential Validation:** Login credentials not being accepted

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Fix email validation logic in both frontend and backend
2. **Check:** Verify Supabase authentication configuration and API keys
3. **Validate:** Test account creation and login flows manually
4. **Debug:** Check Supabase project settings and authentication policies
5. **Test:** Verify environment variables and API endpoints

**Next Steps:** Once authentication issues are resolved, re-run the TestSprite test suite to validate all functional requirements and user journeys.
