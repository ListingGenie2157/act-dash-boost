## 💡 Content Organization

### How Questions Become Lessons:

Your `staging_items` table has:
- `skill_code` - Groups questions into lessons
- `question` - The question text
- `choice_a/b/c/d` - Answer choices
- `answer` - Correct answer
- `explanation` - Why it's correct
- `passage_text` - For reading questions
- `section` - MATH, EN, RD, SCI
- `difficulty` - easy/medium/hard

The system:
1. **Groups** all questions by `skill_code`
2. **Fetches** skill name from `skills` table
3. **Splits** into examples (30%) and practice (70%)
4. **Auto-generates** overview text
5. **Displays** everything beautifully

## 🎯 Examples of What Students See

### Example: "Algebra Basics" Lesson

**Overview Tab:**
```
Algebra Basics

This lesson focuses on solving linear equations.

What You'll Learn:
• Master algebra basics concepts
• Practice with 15 questions
• Build confidence through repetition

Study Tips:
• Read each question carefully
• Review explanations for any you get wrong
• Try to understand the concept, not just memorize

[See 4 Example Questions Below]

Example 1:
Question: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
A) 2  B) 4  C) 5  D) 8

✓ Answer: B) 4
Explanation: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8
             Divide by 2: x = 4
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Want Better Overviews?

Edit `createOverviewFromQuestions()` in `/src/lib/lessons.ts` to:
- Add more detailed intro text
- Include common mistakes
- Add links to resources
- Customize by subject

### Want Different Example/Practice Split?

Edit `/src/lib/lessons.ts`:
```typescript
// Currently: 30% examples, 70% practice
const exampleCount = Math.min(3, Math.floor(questions.length * 0.3));

// Change to 20% examples, 80% practice:
const exampleCount = Math.min(3, Math.floor(questions.length * 0.2));
```

### Want to Add Lesson Content Manually?

Add a `description` to the `skills` table - it will be used as the overview instead of auto-generated text.
