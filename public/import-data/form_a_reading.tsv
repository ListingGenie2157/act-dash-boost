FA_RD_021	A	RD	21	R3	Humanities	Essay	In the new wing, the museum promised “a history of modern design.” The phrase bothered Mara, the curator tasked with arranging the show. History implied a single line; design had never behaved so neatly. Chairs refused to march from ornate to minimal without detours; tools acquired elegance for reasons having little to do with taste. When donors asked whether their favorites would be “featured,” Mara nodded politely and returned to floor plans that looked like tangled yarn. Space was finite, but so was attention, and attention was the rarer constraint. She chose a bentwood chair less for beauty than for its factory photo, where steam curled like handwriting. She placed a plastic lawn chair between two icons to make them explain themselves. Labels were rewritten to show use before authorship. Visitors wandered in expecting masterpieces and found arguments arranged on platforms. Some grew irritated, as if they had been asked to assemble the exhibit themselves. “Good,” Mara said in the quiet before opening. “They’ll have to decide what belongs.”	What is the central claim of the passage?	Design history is a simple linear progression.	Curation can frame design as questions rather than answers.	Donors should control exhibition choices.	Labels are more important than objects.	B	Mara organizes to provoke thinking, not to tell a single line.	Donors should control exhibition choices.	Labels are more important than objects.
