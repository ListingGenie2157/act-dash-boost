## 🔍 Discovered Existing Code & Reused

### Database Tables (All Existing)
- ✅ `profiles` - test_date, daily_time_cap_mins
- ✅ `user_profiles` - age_verified, tos_accepted, privacy_accepted
- ✅ `user_preferences` - daily_minutes, study hours, email settings
- ✅ `user_goals` - start_with preference (diagnostic vs daily)
- ✅ `accommodations` - time_multiplier (not included in wizard but table exists)

### Onboarding Steps from Existing Code
The existing `src/pages/Onboarding.tsx` contained:
1. ✅ Legal/consent checkboxes → **StepAccount**
2. ✅ Test date picker → **StepTestDate**
3. ✅ Accommodations selector → (skipped, table exists if needed later)
4. ✅ Study preferences → **StepPreferences**
5. ✅ Email notifications → **StepNotifications**
6. ✅ Starting path choice → **StepDiagnostic**
7. ✅ Past scores input → (optional, moved to later)

All these were refactored into individual step components.

### UI Components Reused
- ✅ Card, Button, Input, Label, Checkbox from `@/components/ui`
- ✅ Calendar, Popover from date picker
- ✅ Select, Switch, RadioGroup from form controls
- ✅ toast from Sonner
- ✅ date-fns for date formatting
- ✅ React Query for data fetching
- ✅ Supabase client

### Routes & Features Preserved
- ✅ `/login` - Login page unchanged
- ✅ `/onboarding` - Legacy onboarding still accessible
- ✅ `/diagnostic` - Diagnostic test flow
- ✅ `/sim-english`, `/sim-math`, etc. - Simulations
- ✅ `/cheatsheets/*` - Study resources
- ✅ `/analytics` - Progress tracking
- ✅ `/parent-portal` - Parent access

---

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### New User Flow ✅
1. Sign up → sees wizard at step 1
2. Complete all steps → redirects to diagnostic/dashboard
3. Login again → goes directly to dashboard (no wizard)

### Mid-Onboarding Resume Flow ✅
1. Start wizard, complete 3 steps
2. Close browser or logout
3. Login again → resumes at step 4

### Completed User Flow ✅
1. Login with `onboarding_complete = true`
2. Goes directly to dashboard
3. No wizard shown

### Data Persistence ✅
- Each step saves to appropriate table
- `profiles.onboarding_step` updated after each step
- `profiles.onboarding_complete` set to true on final step
- Data survives page refresh

### Type Safety ✅
- All TypeScript types properly defined
- Supabase types updated with new columns
- No `any` except for form data merging
- Component props strongly typed

## 🎨 UX Details Implemented

### Full-Screen Wizard
- ✅ Centered layout with max-width 2xl
- ✅ Header: "Getting you ACT-ready"
- ✅ Subheader: "Complete your profile to get started"

### Stepper UI
- ✅ Horizontal left-to-right stepper
- ✅ 7 labeled steps: Account, Test Date, Diagnostic, Preferences, Notifications, Plan, Done
- ✅ Visual indicators: completed (checkmark), active (highlighted), upcoming (muted)
- ✅ Progress line connects steps

### Buttons
- ✅ **Next** - Primary button, advances to next step
- ✅ **Back** - Outline button, returns to previous step (hidden on first step)
- ✅ **Skip** - Outline button, shown on optional steps (Notifications)
- ✅ **Continue** - Used on informational steps

### Progress Persistence
- ✅ Auto-saves after each Next/Skip click
- ✅ No "Save & Exit" button (auto-save on navigation)
- ✅ `onboarding_step` column tracks current position

### Redirect Logic
- ✅ Not logged in → existing auth flow (handled by Index)
- ✅ Logged in + incomplete → show wizard
- ✅ Logged in + complete → show dashboard

---

## 🚀 Features Preserved (No Breaking Changes)

- ✅ **Auth Flow**: Login/Signup unchanged
- ✅ **Dashboard**: All existing dashboard features work
- ✅ **Study Now**: Daily study plan accessible after onboarding
- ✅ **Simulations**: English/Math/Reading/Science sims available
- ✅ **Cheatsheets**: Study resources accessible
- ✅ **Analytics**: Progress tracking works
- ✅ **Parent Portal**: Parent view unchanged
- ✅ **Diagnostic**: Diagnostic test flow works
- ✅ **Legacy Onboarding**: `/onboarding` route still exists

## 📊 Step Mapping to Database

| Step | Component | Database Table | Columns |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 1. Account | StepAccount | `user_profiles` | age_verified, tos_accepted, privacy_accepted |
| 2. Test Date | StepTestDate | `profiles` | test_date |
| 3. Diagnostic | StepDiagnostic | (saved to formData) | Used for redirect decision |
| 4. Preferences | StepPreferences | `user_preferences` | daily_minutes, preferred_start_hour, preferred_end_hour |
| 5. Notifications | StepNotifications | `user_preferences` | email_notifications, quiet_start_hour, quiet_end_hour |
| 6. Plan | StepPlan | (no data) | Informational only |
| 7. Done | StepDone | `profiles` | onboarding_complete = true |

**Progress Tracking:** `profiles.onboarding_step` updated after each step (1-7).

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

### Intentionally Skipped
- **Accommodations step**: Table exists (`accommodations`) but not included in wizard for simplicity. Can be added later as Step 2.5.
- **Target score input**: Not in current schema. Could be added to `user_goals` if needed.
- **Past scores input**: Exists in old onboarding but moved to optional/post-onboarding flow.
- **Save & Exit button**: Auto-save on navigation is sufficient.

### Stubs Created
**None.** All steps map to existing tables and schemas.

### Dependencies Added
**None.** All dependencies (React Query, Supabase, date-fns, Sonner, shadcn/ui) already present.

## 🔧 How to Test Locally

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
# This adds onboarding_complete and onboarding_step columns
# Run this if testing against local Supabase instance
```

### 2. Create New User
```bash
# Sign up at /login
# Should immediately see wizard at step 1
```

### 3. Test Resume Flow
```bash
# Complete 3 steps
# Logout or close tab
# Login again → should resume at step 4
```

### 4. Test Completed User
```bash
# Use SQL to manually set: UPDATE profiles SET onboarding_complete = true WHERE id = '...'
# Login → should see dashboard, not wizard
```

### 5. Check TypeScript
```bash
npm run build
# Should compile without errors
```

## 📝 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- **Accommodations step**: Add time multiplier selection (100%/150%/200%)
- **Target score**: Collect ACT target score (20-36)
- **Progress percentage**: Show "60% complete" indicator
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions between steps
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate steps
- **Skip all**: Button to skip entire wizard (for testing)
- **Edit mode**: Allow users to edit onboarding answers later
- **Tooltips**: Explain why each field is collected
