# 🎯 Weak Area Emphasis - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Weak Area Detection System**
Automatically identifies skills needing attention based on mastery data:

**Priority Levels:**
- 🔴 **Critical** (< 60% accuracy) - Needs immediate focus
- 🟠 **High** (60-74% accuracy) - Practice more
- 🟡 **Medium** (75-89% accuracy) - Almost there

### 2. **Dashboard Integration**
Added side-by-side cards on main dashboard:
- **Mastery Progress** (left) - Shows overall progress
- **Weak Areas** (right) - Shows top 3 skills needing focus

### 3. **Dedicated Weak Areas Page** (`/weak-areas`)
Complete page with:
- Priority breakdown cards (Critical/High/Medium counts)
- Filter tabs (All, Critical, High, Medium)
- Grouped by subject (Math, English, Reading, Science)
- Action buttons: "Review Lesson" and "Practice Drill"
- Study recommendations for critical skills

### 4. **Visual Indicators**
- Color-coded cards (red/orange/yellow)
- Priority badges
- Progress bars showing current accuracy
- Motivational messages

## 📊 How It Works

### Detection Algorithm
1. **Query mastery table** for all user skills
2. **Filter** skills with < 90% accuracy
3. **Prioritize**:
   - Critical: < 60%
   - High: 60-74%
   - Medium: 75-89%
4. **Sort** by priority, then by accuracy (lowest first)

### Auto-Updates
- Recalculates after each quiz completion
- Uses mastery data (already tracking)
- Cached for 5 minutes (performance)

---

## 🚀 Impact & Benefits

### For Students:
✅ **Crystal clear** what needs work  
✅ **Prioritized** list (most critical first)  
✅ **Action buttons** make it easy to practice  
✅ **Visual feedback** with color coding  
✅ **Progress tracking** over time  

### For You:
✅ Shows your app is **personalized**  
✅ **Increases engagement** (students know what to do next)  
✅ **Data-driven** recommendations  
✅ **Gamification** element (fix the red ones!)

- `/src/hooks/useWeakAreas.ts` - React Query hooks

### UI Components
- `/src/components/WeakAreasCard.tsx` - Dashboard card (shows top 3)
- `/src/pages/WeakAreas.tsx` - Full page (shows all)

### Integration
- `/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Added WeakAreasCard
- `/src/App.tsx` - Added `/weak-areas` route

## 🎯 Next Step: Study Plan Integration

The weak areas system is now **detecting** problems. The next logical step is to make the **study plan generator** use this data.

### Study Plan Enhancement (~30 min)

Edit `/supabase/functions/generate-study-plan/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Current: Generates generic daily tasks
// Enhancement: Weight tasks toward weak areas

async function generateStudyPlan(userId: string, testDate: string) {
  // 1. Fetch weak areas
  const { data: mastery } = await supabase
    .from('mastery')
    .select('skill_id, correct, total')
    .eq('user_id', userId);
  
  // 2. Calculate weak skills (< 75% accuracy)
  const weakSkills = mastery
    .map(m => ({
      skill_id: m.skill_id,
      accuracy: (m.correct / m.total) * 100
    }))
    .filter(s => s.accuracy < 75)
    .sort((a, b) => a.accuracy - b.accuracy); // Worst first
  
  // 3. Allocate time
  // - 60% of tasks focus on weak areas
  // - 30% on proficient areas (maintenance)
  // - 10% on new content
  
  // 4. Generate daily plan
  const plan = [];
  for (let day = 0; day < daysUntilTest; day++) {
    const tasks = [];
    
    // Add 2-3 weak area tasks
    weakSkills.slice(0, 3).forEach(weak => {
      tasks.push({
        type: 'DRILL',
        skill_code: weak.skill_id,
        size: 10,
        estimated_mins: 15,
        content_hint: 'Focus area'
      });
    });
    
    // Add 1 review task
    // Add 1 new learning task
    
    plan.push({ the_date: getDate(day), tasks_json: tasks });
  }
  
  return plan;
}
```

This would make the study plan **dynamically adapt** to weak areas! 🔥

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Complete Some Quizzes
- Go to any lesson with practice questions
- Complete quizzes with varying scores
- Aim for some < 75% to trigger weak areas

### 2. Check Dashboard
- Navigate to main dashboard
- Look for "Areas Needing Focus" card
- Should show your lowest-scoring skills

### 3. Visit Weak Areas Page
- Click "View All Weak Areas" or go to `/weak-areas`
- See full breakdown by priority
- Try filter tabs (All, Critical, High, Medium)

### 4. Test Actions
- Click "Review Lesson" → should go to lesson page
- Click "Practice Drill" → should start drill

### 5. Database Check
```sql
-- View your weak areas calculation
SELECT 
  m.skill_id,
  s.name,
  s.subject,
  m.correct,
  m.total,
  ROUND((m.correct::float / m.total) * 100, 1) as accuracy,
  CASE 
    WHEN (m.correct::float / m.total) < 0.6 THEN 'Critical'
    WHEN (m.correct::float / m.total) < 0.75 THEN 'High'
    WHEN (m.correct::float / m.total) < 0.9 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Good'
  END as priority
FROM mastery m
JOIN skills s ON m.skill_id = s.id
WHERE m.user_id = 'your-user-id'
  AND m.total > 0
  AND (m.correct::float / m.total) < 0.9
ORDER BY accuracy ASC;
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Priority Thresholds
Edit `/src/lib/weakAreas.ts`:

```typescript
// In getWeakAreas function
if (mastery.accuracy < 60) {
  priority = 'critical'; // Change from 60
}
else if (mastery.accuracy < 75) {
  priority = 'high'; // Change from 75
}
```

### Change Colors
Edit `/src/lib/weakAreas.ts` → `getPriorityColor()`:

```typescript
case 'critical':
  return {
    bg: 'bg-red-50', // Change colors here
    text: 'text-red-700',
    // ...
  };
```

### Change Number Shown on Dashboard
Edit `/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`:

```tsx
<WeakAreasCard limit={3} /> // Change from 3 to 5, 10, etc.
```
